# ObjView2Ins
Build Cakewalk INS-file based on ObjView export of Kurzweil SE Multi objects

This script uses the exported TXT file from ObjectView 0.98b beta by Brian Cowell. <br>
Have a look at the Mastering VAST forum --> https://forums.godlike.com.au

Usage:
 * Save all data on Forte SE to XXX.FSE
 * Rename XXX.FSE to XXX.FOR
 * open XXX.FOR in ObjView, ignore version errors
 * select MULTI and export as TXT-file 
 * put file in same folder as objview2ins.py
 * run objview2ins.py
 
 Depending on fullINS you will get the outputfiles
 * fortese.ins - with a reduced (i.e. used) multi index
 * fortese-full.ins - with all possible multis

Have Fun!<br>
